      I went to school at DevMountain in Provo in August 2016 for Web development and initially learned AngularJS, NodeJS and PostgreSQL. I was hired on as a mentor at DevMountain in March of 2017 where I taught the students a variety of web development topics and would lead reviews on any topic the students requested. Six months into my time working there we changed our curriculum to teach React.js and I was not given much warning so I had to learn it just with only a few days notice before the students were learning it. I was able to stay ahead of them as I had experience learning Angular.js so the skills transfered over quickly.

      In August of 2017 DevMountain opened up a new campus in Phoenix Arizona and needed experienced staff to help set up the campus. I volenteered to go down and spent 3 months there doing a lot of teaching, to both the students and the newly hired staff on how DevMountian does things. This was a tremendously powerful experience for me as I was able to show off and develop a variety of skills, both coding related and soft skills.

      I continued to work at DevMountain where I acrued more responsibilites. I started teaching more and more lectures to the point where I could teach almost any of topics we focused on. Eventually we had an instructor leave and I was hired on as an instructor with the responsibily to teach and manage the classes and staff over specific classes.

      On my own initative I created two video series to address a hole in the students education that I was seeing. Some students were comming in with little to no knowlege on how to use basic funcitons of a computer so I created a video series I called Computer Literacy to cover the basics of computer usage. I also found that I was considered rare for using so many keyboard shortcuts and not using the mouse so much. So I created yet another course to show how to work quickly in DevMountains code editor of choice, VS Code.

      I spent most of my teens and early 20's working and volunteering at a program called the Christa McAauliffe Education Center where we would teach elementary to middle school students about space and social studies through simulated experiences. The program was run through the Utah valley school district so a large portion of our staff was volenteered based. Filling the paid posistions almost always came from the voleenteers, because runing the experience properly took a lot of training and knowlege of the equipment.

      I volenteered around 1,000 hours before I was promoted to a flight director which was someone who was paid to run the experiences for paying customers. Also during my time working there I got familiar with the software developmentn side of the company and taught myself to read the code well enought to fix issues that would pop up during the experience. This taught me how to debug code in a very methodical way.

      Because of my experience and knowlege of how the simulator worked I was recruited into another company that wanted to turn the idea into a for profit company. I was put incharge of a location and had to manage all 4 simulators at that location,including schedules and training of the new staff. I created a few videos and lectures to give our onboarding staff reference materials for how to run the experience up to the companies standards.

      While working for this company I saw there was a big need for graphics creation so I taught myself how to use adobe Illustator and After Effects to help create high quality content for the experiences. I became good enough at this that the company transistioned me into creating graphics full time for them and me and anoter employee created over 50 interfaces for their new software. All the while I was also learning how to create motion graphics using After Effects and created a fair amount of proof of concepts videos for them.

      I also helped design the functionality for the software that the company would go onto using exclusivly as their flagship product. I was not making the money that I had hoped for so I felt the need to sperate myself from the company and then transioned into learning how to program at DevMountain.

      I was born in Washington state and moved to Utah when I was 12. I have always been a bit of a nerd and enjoyed creating things and expaning my knowlege base on anything I could. I taught myslef the basics of programming through a game called StarCraft that would allow you to create your own custom maps and create triggers and events based on how the players inputs. I also dabbled in video creation by filimg family events and my familys motorized recriation activites. I have always been drawn to skills that invovle computers because of my previous experiences.

      Around the age of 14 my friends told me about a program in the area that essentially let you be the captain of your own star ship in a role play setting that focused on educating its participants. I fell in love with it intantly but the cutoff to attend camps was 15 and I had not had my fill at that point. So I started volenteering for the program and got exposure a multitite of different experiences, like Acting, Improv, Education, Programming, Illustratiton, Motion Graphics and story writing. Since most of the program was maintined by people under the age of 20 and largely for free I was able to pick up all those skills and practice them on my own time. I ended up volenteering around 1,000 hours of my time to that program and was very rewarded in experience because of that place.

      In my early 20's I was working with many different space center programs but felt that it was not the best option for me in the long run so I started pursuing different options. I worked at a variety of tech support jobs and went to college and started to study Information Systems. The college setting was to slow to me and I knew I could learn things faster than that so I found DevMountain, a coding bootcamp, and I learned the skills needed to be a web developer. I was hired on after graduation as a mentor and I moved up the ranks until I became an instructor teching many of the classes.
