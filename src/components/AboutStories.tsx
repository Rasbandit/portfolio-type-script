      I went to school at DevMountain for Web development in August of 2016. Where I learned AngularJS, NodeJS and PostgreSQL. I was hired on as a mentor at DevMountain in March of 2017 where I taught the students a variety of web development topics and would lead reviews on any topic the students requested. Six months into my time working there we changed our curriculum to teach React.js, The mentors were not given much warning and I had to learn enough to teach and debugging it. I quickly became very competent in React as it became my main focus.

      In August of 2017 DevMountain opened up a new campus in Phoenix Arizona and needed experienced staff to help set up the campus. I volunteered to go down and spent 3 months there doing a lot of teaching, to both the students and the newly hired staff on how DevMountain does things. This was a tremendously powerful experience for me as I was able to show off and develop a variety of skills, both technical and soft skills.

      I continued to work at DevMountain where I accrued more responsibilities. I started teaching more and more lectures to the point where I could lead the lectures on almost any of the topics. Eventually we had an instructor leave and I was hired on as an instructor with the responsibly to teach and manage the classes and staff over specific classes.

      On my own initiative I created two video series to address a hole in the students education that I was seeing. Some students were coming in with little to no knowledge on how to use basic functions of a computer so I created a video series I called Computer Literacy to cover the basics of computer usage. I also found that I was considered rare for using so many keyboard shortcuts and focusing on speed and efficiency. So I created yet another course to show how to work quickly in DevMountains code editor of choice, VSCode.

      I spent most of my teens and early 20's working and volunteering at a program called the Christa McAauliffe Education Center where we would teach elementary to middle school students about space and social studies through simulated experiences. The program was run through the Utah valley school district so a large portion of our staff was volunteered based. Filling the paid positions almost always came from the volunteers, because running the experience properly took a lot of training and knowledge of the equipment.

      I volunteered around 1,000 hours before I was promoted to a flight director which was someone who was paid to run the experiences for paying customers. Also during my time working there I got familiar with the software development side of the company and taught myself to read the code well enough to fix issues that would pop up during the experience. This taught me how to debug code in a very methodical way.

      Because of my experience and knowledge of how the simulator worked I was recruited into another company that wanted to turn the idea into a for profit company. I was put in charge of a location and had to manage all 4 simulators at that location, including schedules and training of the new staff. I created a few videos and training classes to give our on boarding staff reference materials for how to run the experience up to the companies standards.

      While working for this company I saw there was a big need for graphics creation so I taught myself how to use adobe Illustrator and After Effects to help create high quality content for the experiences. I became good enough at this that the company transitioned me into creating graphics full time for them and me and another employee created over 50 interfaces for their new software. All the while I was also learning how to create motion graphics using After Effects and created a fair amount of proof of concepts videos for them.

      I also helped design the functionality for the software that the company would go onto using exclusively as their flagship product. I was not making the money that I had hoped for so I felt the need to separate myself from the company and then transitioned into learning how to program at DevMountain.

      I have always been a bit of a nerd and enjoyed creating things and learning as much as I can. I taught myself the basics of programming through a game called StarCraft that would allow you to create your own custom maps and create triggers and events based on players’ input. Because of this, I have always been drawn to skills that involve computers and problem-solving.

      Around the age of 14, my friends told me about a program in the area that let you be the captain of your own starship in a role play setting. I fell in love with it, but the age cutoff to attend camps was 15, so I started volunteering for the program. I got exposure to various different skills, like Acting, Improvisation, Education, Programming, Illustration, Motion Graphics and Story Writing. I ended up volunteering around 1,000 hours, practicing these skills on my own, and eventually got hired on as a paid staff where I continued to learn and grow.

      In my early 20's, I worked at a variety of tech support jobs and began college studying Information Systems. I realized I needed a more fast-paced, leading me to attend DevMountain, a coding Bootcamp. There I learned the skills needed to be a web developer and found my passion for coding and creating projects from scratch. I was hired on after graduation as a mentor. I moved up the ranks at DevMountain until I became a Lead Mentor and was over many of the mentor teams. I’m always looking to further my education and continue building projects whenever I can.
