      I went to school at DevMountain for Web development in August of 2016. Where I learned AngularJS, NodeJS and PostgreSQL. I was hired on as a mentor at DevMountain in March of 2017 where I taught the students a variety of web development topics and would lead reviews on any topic the students requested. Six months into my time working there we changed our curriculum to teach React.js, The mentors were not given much warning and I had to learn enough to teach and debugging it. I quickly became very competent in React as it became my main focus.

      In August of 2017 DevMountain opened up a new campus in Phoenix Arizona and needed experienced staff to help set up the campus. I volunteered to go down and spent 3 months there doing a lot of teaching, to both the students and the newly hired staff on how DevMountain does things. This was a tremendously powerful experience for me as I was able to show off and develop a variety of skills, both technical and soft skills.

      I continued to work at DevMountain where I accrued more responsibilities. I started teaching more and more lectures to the point where I could lead the lectures on almost any of the topics. Eventually we had an instructor leave and I was hired on as an instructor with the responsibly to teach and manage the classes and staff over specific classes.

      On my own initiative I created two video series to address a hole in the students education that I was seeing. Some students were coming in with little to no knowledge on how to use basic functions of a computer so I created a video series I called Computer Literacy to cover the basics of computer usage. I also found that I was considered rare for using so many keyboard shortcuts and focusing on speed and efficiency. So I created yet another course to show how to work quickly in DevMountains code editor of choice, VSCode.

      I spent most of my teens and early 20's working and volunteering at a program called the Christa McAauliffe Education Center where we would teach elementary to middle school students about space and social studies through simulated experiences. The program was run through the Utah valley school district so a large portion of our staff was volunteered based. Filling the paid positions almost always came from the volunteers, because running the experience properly took a lot of training and knowledge of the equipment.

      I volunteered around 1,000 hours before I was promoted to a flight director which was someone who was paid to run the experiences for paying customers. Also during my time working there I got familiar with the software development side of the company and taught myself to read the code well enough to fix issues that would pop up during the experience. This taught me how to debug code in a very methodical way.

      Because of my experience and knowledge of how the simulator worked I was recruited into another company that wanted to turn the idea into a for profit company. I was put in charge of a location and had to manage all 4 simulators at that location, including schedules and training of the new staff. I created a few videos and training classes to give our on boarding staff reference materials for how to run the experience up to the companies standards.

      While working for this company I saw there was a big need for graphics creation so I taught myself how to use adobe Illustrator and After Effects to help create high quality content for the experiences. I became good enough at this that the company transitioned me into creating graphics full time for them and me and another employee created over 50 interfaces for their new software. All the while I was also learning how to create motion graphics using After Effects and created a fair amount of proof of concepts videos for them.

      I also helped design the functionality for the software that the company would go onto using exclusively as their flagship product. I was not making the money that I had hoped for so I felt the need to separate myself from the company and then transitioned into learning how to program at DevMountain.

      I was born in Washington state and moved to Utah when I was 12. I have always been a bit of a nerd and enjoyed creating things and expanding my knowledge on anything I could. I taught myself the basics of programming through a game called StarCraft that would allow you to create your own custom maps and create triggers and events based on players input. I also dabbled in video creation by filming family events and my family's motorized recreation activities. I have always been drawn to skills that involve computers because of my previous experiences.

      Around the age of 14 my friends told me about a program in the area that essentially let you be the captain of your own star ship in a role play setting that focused on educating its participants. I fell in love with it, but the age cutoff to attend camps was 15 but still wanted to get more involved. So I started volunteering for the program and got exposure a multitude of different experiences, like Acting, Improvisation, Education, Programming, Illustration, Motion Graphics and Story Writing. Since most of the program was maintained by people under the age of 20 and largely for free I was able to pick up all those skills and practice them on my own time. I ended up volunteering around 1,000 hours of my time to that program before I was hired on as a paid staff and was very rewarded in experience because of that place.

      In my early 20's I was working with many different space center programs but felt that it was not the best option for me in the long run so I started pursuing different options. I worked at a variety of tech support jobs and went to college and started to study Information Systems. The college setting was to slow for me and I knew I could learn things faster than that so I attended DevMountain, a coding bootcamp, and I learned the skills needed to be a web developer. I was hired on after graduation as a mentor and I moved up the ranks until I became an Lead Mentor teaching many of the classes.
